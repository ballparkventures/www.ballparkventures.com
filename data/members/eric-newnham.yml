  Eric built up and sold one of the world's largest Out of Home media
  specialists (billing â‚¬4.4 Billion), while managing to remain faithful through
  the ups, downs and downs of Spurs over the years.


  His worst job was a chef at KFC, which could explain why he became an avid
  Twitcher in later life.
